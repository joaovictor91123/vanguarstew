"""Gate whether a run's pairwise judge was robust enough to trust its verdicts.

The M2/M3 acceptance leans on judge robustness — "pairwise judging, dual-order consistency,
disagreement tracking." A composite score is only as trustworthy as the judge behind it: if the
run was judged in a single presentation order, or the two orders disagreed on a large fraction
of tasks, the win/loss record (and the ``judge_mean`` half of the composite) is shaky.
``run_eval`` reports the judge stats, but whether they clear the bar is decided by eye.

This makes that a reproducible **pass/fail gate**. ``check_judge(result)`` evaluates a
single- or multi-repo run against named criteria:

1. ``dual_order_judging`` - the run judged both presentation orders (``judge_dual_order`` is
   true), the mode that yields a consistency signal at all;
2. ``enough_dual_order_tasks`` - at least ``min_dual_order_tasks`` tasks were judged in both
   orders, so the disagreement rate is measured on a meaningful sample;
3. ``low_disagreement`` - the order-``disagreement_rate`` is at most ``max_disagreement`` (the
   judge's verdicts are stable across order, not flipping on presentation).

The companion ``scripts/judge_gate.py`` exits non-zero when the judge isn't robust, so a run's
verdicts can be gated in CI before they're trusted.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates the result, and a malformed/non-dict result simply fails
the relevant checks rather than raising.
