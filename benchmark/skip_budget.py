"""Gate whether a multi-repo run scored enough of its repos to be trusted.

``run_multi_replay`` attempts a set of repos and scores the ones that clone, build, and produce
tasks; the rest are *skipped* (``skipped = repos - scored_repos``). The headline composite is then
a mean over the repos that *did* score. Nothing stops a run that skipped most of its set - because
of clone failures, missing toolchains, or setup errors - from reporting a composite over a small,
biased subset as if it covered the whole set. M3/M4 ask the agent to hold up across *diverse*
repos; a run that quietly dropped the hard ones doesn't demonstrate that.

``repo_set_readiness`` validates the repo-set *config* (enough tuned/held-out repos are declared);
this gates the run *outcome* (enough of them actually scored). ``check_skip_budget(result)``
evaluates named criteria, each failing closed:

1. ``multi_repo_accounting`` - the result carries a coherent multi-repo tally: ``repos`` and
   ``scored_repos`` are whole numbers, ``0 <= scored_repos <= repos``, ``repos > 0``, and (when
   present) ``skipped`` equals ``repos - scored_repos``. A single-repo run, fractional counts, or
   inconsistent counts fails this check (there is nothing to trust).
2. ``enough_scored`` - at least ``min_scored`` repos produced a score.
3. ``skip_within_budget`` - the skipped fraction (``skipped / repos``) is at most ``max_skip_rate``.

The companion ``scripts/skip_budget.py`` exits non-zero when too many repos were skipped.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates the result, and a malformed/non-dict result (including one
with a non-list ``checks``) simply fails the relevant checks rather than raising.
