"""Gate a ``--generalization`` result against the M3/M4 acceptance criteria.

The M3/M4 acceptance run (ROADMAP.md) is an explicit, still-open deliverable: run
``run_eval --generalization`` on the curated set and confirm it *completes clean* and that the
``generalization_gap`` is *reasonable*. Today that check is a manual eyeballing of the JSON.

This makes it a reproducible **pass/fail gate**. ``check_acceptance(report)`` evaluates a
``run_generalization_report`` artifact against named criteria and returns a structured verdict;
the companion ``scripts/acceptance.py`` exits non-zero when it fails, so a benchmark run can be
gated in CI the way ``--fail-under`` gates a single score.

The criteria (each a named, independently-reported check):

1. ``is_generalization`` - the artifact is a generalization report (``tuned``/``held_out``
   partitions plus a ``generalization_gap``);
2. ``no_partition_error`` - neither partition carries an ``error`` (the run completed clean);
3. ``both_partitions_scored`` - each partition scored at least ``min_scored_repos`` repos, so
   the gap contrasts two real measurements;
4. ``gap_computed`` - ``generalization_gap`` is a number (it is ``None`` unless both partitions
   scored, so this guards against a silently-missing gap);
5. ``gap_within_bound`` - ``generalization_gap <= max_gap``: held-out performance did not
   collapse relative to tuned (a *reasonable* gap).

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates the report, and a malformed/non-dict report simply fails
the relevant checks rather than raising.
