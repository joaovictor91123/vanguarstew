"""Gate whether a replay run is strong enough to promote the challenger agent.

A benchmark exists to decide *whether one agent is good enough to prefer over the reference* —
and the M2 acceptance is explicit that "an agent that merely restates a memorized outcome does
**not** win." Today ``run_eval`` reports the raw numbers (``composite_mean``, ``decisive_margin``,
judge stats), but the *decision* — is this run good enough? — is made by eye.

This makes that decision a reproducible **pass/fail gate**. ``check_promotion(result)`` evaluates
a single-repo (``run_replay``) or multi-repo (``run_multi_replay``) result against named criteria:

1. ``run_completed`` - the run produced a scored result (no ``error``, a numeric composite);
2. ``composite_floor`` - ``composite_mean`` is at least ``min_composite``;
3. ``beats_baseline`` - the challenger **decisively** beat the baseline: ``decisive_margin``
   (challenger wins minus baseline wins) is at least ``min_decisive_margin``, so a memorized-tie
   agent that does not actually out-decide the reference does not pass;
4. ``judge_trustworthy`` - the pairwise judge's order-``disagreement_rate`` is at most
   ``max_disagreement`` (a run whose verdicts flip on presentation order isn't a trustworthy
   basis for promotion). A run judged single-order carries no disagreement rate and passes this
   check, since there is no instability signal to fail on.

The companion ``scripts/promotion.py`` exits non-zero when the gate fails, so promotion can be
gated in CI the way ``--fail-under`` gates a single score.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates the result, and a malformed/non-dict result simply fails
the relevant checks rather than raising.
